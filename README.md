# 📊 Digital Health Market Landscape

**A Power BI dashboard project analysing global competition in the wearable health tech market using public datasets.**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores how leading wearable health device companies compare in terms of:
- Product innovation
- Regulatory readiness (ex. MDR compliance)
- Geographic reach
- Market positioning

It simulates a real-world benchmarking analysis to support strategic decisions in pricing, regional expansion, and product feature differentiation, through interactive dashboards and structured datasets.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** Publicly available data from manufacturer websites, reviews, product listings, and health tech databases  
- **Sample Size:** 15–20 wearables from companies such as Apple, Fitbit, Withings, Garmin, WHOOP, Oura  
- **Fields:**
  - `Device_Name`, `Brand`, `Price_EUR`, `Form_Factor`
  - `Features_Tracked`, `Battery_Life`, `MDR_Ready`
  - `Launch_Year`, `App_Rating`, `Countries_Active`

> Dataset compiled manually with emphasis on transparency, clarity, and regulatory relevance.
